# Implement-LinkedList-Data-Structure
A linked list is a set of dynamically allocated nodes, arranged in such a way that each node contains one value and one pointer.
After arrays, the second most popular data structure is Linked List. A linked list is a linear data structure, made of a chain of nodes in which each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the chain. In this article, letâ€™s see how to implement a linked list in C.
What is Linked List in C?
A Linked List is a linear data structure. Every linked list has two parts, the data section and the address section that holds the address of the next element in the list, which is called a node.
The size of the linked list is not fixed, and data items can be added at any locations in the list. The disadvantage is that to get to a node, we must traverse to all the way from the first node to the node that we require. The Linked List is like an array but unlike an array, it is not stored sequentially in the memory.
